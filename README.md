The purpose of this project is to create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" type game where the user inputs their choice of "Rock, Paper, or Scissors" and the computer randomly chooses their option.
The first to five, wins the game.

Updated the game in which the user's input is done by buttons, instead of typing out their choice or "rock, paper, or scissors."
Created a stylalized webpage using HTML and CSS.
Practiced implementing DOM manipulation into the JavaScript code in order to create a fully functioning game.
